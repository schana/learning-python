# Pine Trees

Write a program that asks the user for a width, and then print out their resulting tree.

Examples:
```
How wide should the tree be? 5

Here's your tree:

   *
  ***
 *****
   |

How wide should the tree be? 6

Here's your tree:

   **
  ****
 ******
   ||
```

**Extra challenge**: Add a parameter asking for the height and adjust the tree accordingly.

Example:

```
How wide should the tree be? 5
How tall should the tree be? 4

Here's your tree:

   *
  ***
 *****
 *****
   |
```
